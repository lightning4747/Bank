basically, today is Day 1

goal: the plan is to learn about the elements in login page and sign up page and develop one, additionally I'll try to style it aswell let's see how many days it's gonna take. 

ideas : theme is gonna be gazi ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° , gazi's website, and pretty much try to add title tage to all the elements in the page, I wanna add the tree from her website,have to return back to it. planning to add a alot of Easter eggs hehe.smooth and relaxing musics would be nice.

Report: today finsihed up( partiality) with the sign up page, added some css and learned new kind of implementations of elements like span and input.came across so many new and unexplored elements such as selection, option, input types like mail,number,text,url,tel,date then....learned quite a bit of css aswell, thanks to my mentor.

day 2

ideas: made some changes and decided to include java and c to handle the backend along with js

report : just added the css to the login page and did some changes still not sure, learned(revised) some js, event handling,dom manipulation.

Day 3

ideas : decided to make encryption and decryption tool for security ofcourse in c for speed.

report : added some interactive features like checking whether all the input fields are filled before submitting and shows red border if it's not filled and started with my java aswell. created a hash map and created demo database (own inputs) to check it's working. just constructed the basic logic yet to paint the actual painting (draw the painting or paint? ). noticed somethings, today I learned about the dom manipulation and event handling in quite advanced way, I know it from classes but in a actual practice it feels even more complex and actually I understand the logic behind why and it's the thing that....ts is actual shi , real deal "I don't think I could have a learned it just from class".

day 4

ideas : today the plan is to learn even more java and gonna start to create the homepage after fixing the linking issue in js.

report: absolutely changed the entire folder structure. didn't change a single line of code yet somehow fucked up on the structure and took me 1.30 hrs to fix it and the next thing is tried to learn the files in java got cooked and accedentelly got my third star on hacker rank. just another day went along with the flow.

day 5

ideas : none..

report: fuck ass I hate life, I created the home page it only display the login or signup link with overly well written animations and designs.shit I didn't make it , deepseek and chatgpt obviously. I was only supposed to get the base shits like the necessary fields instead I for some reason made that entire shit with ai now it doesn't even feel like my own own shi, honestly I wanna delete that page. my actual idea was to create the page after logged in but turns out I wrote some useless page but it does look cool but is it necessary? nope then...ughhh I need to create the dashboard and other actual actual banking related shi, having so many stuffs coming up on my dumb ahh.today I found a tutorial on YouTube, it length is about 6 hours or some and he promises to teach tailwind,nextjs,and other frame works most importantly he made actual functioning real world website where you can actually perform the transactions.....deadass fingure this shit out yourself, fuck you
